			Hi! I'm Sergio Cardona, a Fullstack developer with more than 15 years of experience. located in Medell√≠n, Colombia.
		</p>
		<p>
			When I learned about code for the first time, I felt a great passion for technology and for all the things we can made with it. I don't know how many web projects I have participated in! but I do know that I have enjoyed to the fullest each line of code and each hour spent on the computer.
		</p>
		<p>
			At present, I'm focus on the development of ecommerce solutions in Shopify, huge features like entire sites development, complex business rules and also small but nicely features. I feel like I am in a career in which stopping is not an option, you have to keep moving and keep learning! That is why right now I am studying new technologies to improve my frontend skills with React / Angular.
